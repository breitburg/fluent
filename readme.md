# Rocket

Powerful mobile development framework (Inspired by Flutter)

## Getting Started

First of all you need to create a empty project. Use command line util to perform that:

```console
$ rocket new first_app
ðŸ’« Creating new project... (first_app)
```

This command will create an empty project with codebase.

## Requirements

1. You need to compile and install `sdl2-gfx` library for rendering advanced primitive shapes.
2. Must be installed `pysdl2` library
3. Library `reloadr` must be installed for hot reloading

## Plans and Issues

- Add text size calculation
- Add automatically enabling hot reload when it's opened with `--debug` tag
- Implement new material widgets
- Write full documentation
- Add hot reload execution error screen
- Add build instructions
- Add unit tests
- Implement `rocket doctor` command
- Add animations methods
- Add scaling ability
